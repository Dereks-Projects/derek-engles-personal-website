      <h1>About me</h1>
      <p>
        I'm Derek Engles. For over two decades, I’ve worked in hospitality, serving more than 200,000 guests and leading teams across award-winning restaurants and resorts. I’ve spent more than 30,000 hours as a sommelier and wine director, developing training programs for Fortune 500 companies and Michelin-starred establishments.
        </p>

        <p>
          In 2019, I launched my first technology project, <em>Virtual Restaurant Manager</em>—an application designed to connect managers and employees while addressing common challenges in restaurant operations. I collaborated with a development team in Jaipur, India and successfully completed the build in 2021.
        </p>

        <p>
          Today, I’m applying that same focus to the broader tech space—designing web applications, digital tools, and modern learning platforms that solve real-world problems in hospitality and beyond. I bring products to life through clean, responsive design using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, with growing expertise in React and full-stack development. I pair these technical skills with Canva-powered visuals and targeted social media strategy.
        </p>

        <p>
          <strong>Full Stack Plus</strong>: My work bridges deep industry knowledge with digital execution. Projects like <a href="https://www.somm.site" target="_blank">somm.site</a>, <a href="https://www.winequizzes.net" target="_blank">winequizzes.net</a>, and <a href="https://www.distributorpost.com" target="_blank">distributorpost.com</a> showcase my ability to lead projects from concept to completion. I also plan and execute comprehensive social media campaigns to support each product I build.
